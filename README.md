# Econ Interactive Learning

**Live site:** [https://www.mengshanzhao.com/teaching/335](https://www.mengshanzhao.com/teaching/335)  
Learning-by-doing mini games for undergraduate econ/finance courses. Built to make online learning faster, clearer, and more fun.

## Why this exists
I teach online. Some concepts (T-accounts, cash flows, ratios) stick better with short, focused practice. I built these games to help students practice quickly, get instant feedback, and see the “why,” not just the “what.”
